Notes

Packed Malware:

* Packed / obfuscated programs contain very few strings.
* Detect pakcers with PEID

Linked Libraries and Functions:

* Imports are functions used by one program that are actually stored in another program. 

Static Linking - Least common method of linking libraries. All code is copied into the executable. Nothing in PE header indicates linked code. 

Runtime Linking - Only used in malware when packed and only connects to libraries when needed. 

PE Header Sections:

* .text - Contains the executable code.
* .rdata - Holds global data 
* .data - Global data accessed throughout the program. 
* .rsrc - stores resources needed by the program.
